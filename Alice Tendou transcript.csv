Alice;I am finally going on an adventure, Sensei
Alice;I hear I have to train near the town where I am starting out
Alice;So, wish me luck
Sensei;I guess it's finally time…
Alice;Sensei?
Sensei;Alice, I'm glad you're okay
Sensei;I was worried about you
Alice;Ba-ba-ba-bam! Bam bam!
Sensei;Was that a fanfare?!
Alice;Sensei has joined the party
Alice;The warrior has finally gained an ally. Now she has a party of her own
Sensei;Warrior…? Are we doing this now?
Alice;But you are useless in battle, Sensei. You do not have any equipment and you only have one HP
Alice;But that is okay
Alice;You do not have to be good in battle to be helpful to your allies
Sensei;So I'm the support role?
Alice;No. You are the mascot
Alice;You have no use in battle, but you make the rest of the party happy
Sensei;Don't I have any kind of skills…?
Alice;No. You cheer people up. That is it
Alice;It is still a good skill to have
Alice;I am feeling much better now that you are here. That is a proof enough
Alice;Not everyone can make their party members this happy
Alice;That is what makes you so amazing, Sensei
Sensei;T-Thanks, I think
Alice;Now that you are registered to the party, it is time to set off on an adventure
Alice;So, from now on, we will be…   …moving forward
Sensei;Is that all?
Alice;Yes. We will move forward. A warrior's adventure always begins by moving forward
Sensei;I guess we should get started then
Alice;Today's adventure went smoothly
Alice;Will you join the party next time too?
Sensei;Of course, I wouldn't miss it for the world
Alice;That's right
Alice;I love going on adventures with you, Sensei
Alice;Ba-ba-ba-bam! Bam bam!
Alice;I leveled up! I am much stronger than before
Sensei;Congratulations on leveling!
Alice;Today is an excellent opportunity to go on an adventure
Alice;Alice has unlocked many more features after levelling up
Sensei;What kind of features?
Alice;Item looting
Alice;Let me show you
Sensei;Alice, what are you doing?
Alice;You can usually get a lot of items by doing this
Alice;Do you not understand? It is a basic design
Alice;That is how it was in the RPG I just played, as well as the side-scrolling action game from a few days ago
Alice;Oh! I found a recovery item in the pile of trash
Alice;See, Sensei! I found someone's leftover hamburger!
Sensei;You can't do this, Alice!
Sensei;If you eat that, your HP will decrease even more
Alice;Are you sure?
Alice;You must mean it is secretly poison. I do not like poison
Alice;I cannot waste recovery spell on something like this
Alice;We should keep moving
Sensei;Are we going on another walk?
Alice;I would like to go somewhere completely new to me today
Alice;And I would like you to come with me, naturally
Alice;Ready, set, go!
Alice;We have managed to come this far
Alice;Though I am not sure where exactly this is. Do you know?
Sensei;It doesn't feel like a very friendly neighborhood…
Thug 1;Check it out! Fresh meat!
Thug 2;Heh heh heh!
Sensei;That didn't take long!
Thug 1;Who'da thunk we'd find such prime targets all the way out here? It must be our lucky day!
Thug 2;Heh heh. Hand over everything you got or you'll be sorry
Alice;I understand now. This must be random monster encounter in the field
Alice;*click*
Thug 1;Wha-
Thug 2;Wh-what kind of weapon is that?
Alice;Then I will show you no mercy!
Sensei;Alice! Don't!
Alice;Blinding Light!
Alice;That is strange. I defeated them, but I did not receive any EXP
Alice;And there are no rewards
Alice;Perhaps I am supposed to loot them manually
Sensei;You'll be no better than them if you do that!
Alice;You have to work harder too. How can you sleep comfortably at that level?
Sensei;Um…
Alice;Yes, I will be waiting for you
Alice;I have caused a lot of trouble for the others
Alice;Even the Student Council scolded me…
Alice;Perhaps I should take a break from adventuring
Sensei;You should take a break
Alice;Now I have some time to myself
Alice;I am going to play a new game someone recommended to me
Alice;I borrowed a handheld console, so I will play it at the café
Sensei;Good luck at the café!
Sensei;Hi, Aris
Sensei;Are you playing a game?
Alice;Good morning, Sensei
Alice;I found a hidden ending with the game, but…
Alice;I got a message saying that illegal software had been detected before the ending
Alice;some people from the Seminar came to take the game away
Alice;They said it was an illegally distributed, uncensored copy…
Alice;What does that mean?
Alice;No one will tell me…
Sensei;Some knowledge should never be revealed to the world…
Alice;Really?
Alice;I do not understand, but I can accept
Alice;Thank you for letting me know, Sensei
Sensei;Keep your chin up!
Alice;Yes, I will
Alice;Sensei, do you know much about cats?
Alice;I do not know much about them…
Alice;Cats are very fast
Alice;"And they go, ""meow""!"
Alice;Is there any way to make friends with cats?
Sensei;I'm not sure…
Sensei;What are you looking at?
Alice;Hello, Sensei. Good afternoon
Alice;I am looking at a cat
Sensei;A cat…?
Black cat;*Hiss*
Alice;It is angry, but I do not know what I did to upset it…
Alice;Do you think the cat hates me?
Alice;It was angry yesterday too
Alice;I would like to pet the cat, but it will not let me…
Sensei;Good thing I have these
Alice;What is this, Sensei?
Alice;Is this a key item to raise my bonding level with the cat?!
Alice;Do you know the way to win a cat's heart?
Sensei;Ha. Just watch
Black cat;*Hiss*
Sensei;It's not working?!
Alice;It is even angrier now. You must have chosen the wrong item
Alice;We should leave it alone. I wish we did not have to, but I am out of ideas. This must be the bad ending to its route
Alice;I am sorry. I did not mean to bother you
Alice;Let's go, Sensei
Sensei;Okay… I wish there is something we could do
Black cat;Meow
Alice;It just jumped down and landed right in front of me!
Black cat;Meow
Alice;It is still wary of me, but it does not look angry anymore
Sensei;Maybe it will let you pet it
Alice;You think so?
Alice;I can try…
Black cat;Meow
Alice;Its fur is warm and soft. So this is what a cat feels like
Black cat;Meow…
Sensei;it's gone
Alice;Yes, but that is okay. Today's quest was merely to pet it
Alice;I have gained enough EXP to level up today
Sensei;Yeah, you are growing everyday
Alice;It is a shame the cat did not eat the treats you brought, though
Alice;Did you bring them to help me?
Sensei;I always carry around cat treats
Alice;I know you did, even if you pretend otherwise
Alice;Your kind-hearted nature would not allow you to see me struggle
Alice;I know that for certain
Alice;I am alone at the club today
Alice;I am bored, so you should come play a game with me
Alice;please come visit
Alice;All right, I'll check in on you
Alice;Okay, thank you
Alice;I will be waiting for you
Alice;Good evening, Sensei
Alice;I was just having some quiet time with a game
Sensei;Oh, yeah? What were you playing?
Alice;It is a classic RPG
Alice;RPGs are my favorite. Other games are fun too, but RPGs always hit the spot
Sensei;Swords, magic… you like that kind of stuff?
Alice;Yes, there are things like that in RPGs
Sensei;They have fantasy elements that don't exist in reality
Alice;Is that what you think?
Alice;I see it differently
Alice;I believe magic exists in kivotos as well
Alice;It must. How else could you make me so happy, Sensei?
Alice;Games are fun because they reflect the beauty of the world
Alice;You taught me that
Alice;Games, cats, friends, …and even this moment
Alice;The world is full of beautiful things
Alice;And I want to know more of them. Together with you, Sensei
Alice;I want to learn more about this world!
Alice;How do the treasure chests get into the dungeons?
Alice;And why do they have items inside?
Alice;Did someone put them there?
Alice;I don't know who did it, but they must be very nice
Alice;I want to be someone who fills treasure chests too
Sensei;Well you have my support, Alice
Alice;Thank you Sensei
Alice;Alice investigated the trash can, but didn't find anything
Sensei;Alice?
Alice;Oh, Sensei!
Sensei;What are you doing Alice?
Alice;Looking for items, of course!
Alice;The room of a rare character like you, usually has valuable items in it
Sensei;O-Oh I see…
Sensei;So were there any rare items?
Alice;Yes, there was one on your desk
Alice;Ba-ba-ba-bam! Bam bam!
Alice;Alice has acquired Sensei's receipt
Sensei;That receipt is a rare item?
Alice;Yes
Alice;Believe it or not, this receipt is for a new transforming robot that sensei bought for the price of 100.000 yen
Alice;When you use this item, Yuuka comes to scold Sensei
Alice;It's the ultimate unit-summoning item!
Sensei;A-Alice, would you mind returning that receipt to me?
Alice;Hmmm… Hero, you desire this item?
Alice;Then complete the quest given by Alice and prove that you're indeed the hero
Alice;Well then, let's see…
Alice;The quest will involve…
Alice;Oh, I know
Alice;The hero always has to acquire the legendary sword!
Alice;Hero, take the Sword of Light resting on that platform in your hand, lift it up and shout the following :
Alice;LIGHT, heed my call!
Sensei;Uhh… So I have to lift your gun, right?
Alice;*nod*
Alice;The one who draws this weapon shall become the lord of the land
Sensei;This thing won't budge
Alice;To think that you would be unable to wield the Sword of Light, it must mean you were never qualified to become the Hero
Sensei;Oh yeah, didn't the Engineering Club girls say that this gun weighs 140 kilograms?
Alice;You're not a high enough level to equip it, in all things, leveling is important
Alice;You'll have to level up, and lift it with pure physical strength
Alice;You should aim for the level cap too
Sensei;No, I can do this with knowledge, if I use the principle of lever…
Alice;That B button…
Alice;I never expected this event where the Sword of Light destroys the map would occur twice
Alice;Maybe the event trigger button is bugged?
Alice;Looks like it needs some debugging
Sensei;Alice…
Alice;Yes?
Sensei;Can you help me clean up?
Alice;Yes!
Sensei;Also give back the receipt…
Alice;No, this belongs to Alice
